# How to get Data
Data is one of the limitations for this project.

## OASIS
https://sites.wustl.edu/oasisbrains/datasets/
We used Oasis-1 and Oasis-2, we are able to download the version we had by scrolling to the bottom of the page of both Oasis 1 and 2.

We will process the images later in this one

There is also Oasis 3 which would be more useful for this project, we were not able to get access for it.

## ADNI
We did not use this, but if you can, you can request for the Data and it should take about a week or two. This dataset is a larger and if you were to use this dataset
there might be better results.


## Privacy Issues
Both of these datasets have issues with agreements and privacy issues, therefore we did not include them in this repo. But accessing the public data should not be too bad.
