# ML-Alzheimers-Detection

## Dataset
We will use the OASIS data that will tell us whether a patient is demented or not. If they are, we will use it as a synonym for Alzheimer's Disease. 
### Data Processing
We extracted data....


## ResNet
ResNet is a type of deep learning neural network. It's great benefit from other NN architectures is that it skips less useful layers. Therefore we are able to save computing.
