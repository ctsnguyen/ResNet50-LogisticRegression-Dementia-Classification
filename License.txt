User will not use the OASIS datasets, either alone or in concert with any other information, to make any effort to identify or contact individuals who are or may be the sources of the information in the dataset. If User inadvertently receives identifiable information or otherwise identifies a subject, User will immediately notify OASIS (oasis-brains@nrg.wustl.edu) and follow OASIS’s reasonable written instructions, which may include the return or destruction of identifiable information. *
2. User is strictly prohibited from generating or using images or comparable representations of the face, head, or body for facial recognition, re-identification, or other purposes that could allow the identities of research participants to be readily ascertained. *
3. Restrictions on Redistribution: User will not use or further disclose the OASIS-3 or OASIS-4 except as required by law. User shall not share, distribute, or otherwise make available the OASIS data, in whole or in part, to any third party, including collaborators, without prior written permission from OASIS. All collaborators must independently apply for access and agree to these terms. Additionally, User will not use or further disclose any derivative works or derivative data of the OASIS datasets, in any case in whole or in part, that could be used to reconstruct a facial image. User shall report to OASIS immediately upon User’s discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure not permitted by this Data Use Agreement. User shall provide the following information: (1) the nature of the use or disclosure; (2) the information used or disclosed; (3) the identity of the persons and/or entities that made the use or disclosure; and (4) what corrective action will be taken by User as a result of the use or disclosure. User shall take any other reasonable actions available to it to mitigate any detrimental effects of the use or disclosure. *
4. User agrees to implement appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the OASIS data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. OASIS data must be stored on secure, access-controlled systems, and only the User authorized under this Data Use Agreement may access the data. *
5. OASIS data are provided for non-commercial, academic research purposes only. Any commercial use, including but not limited to the sale of data or commercial consulting, is strictly prohibited without explicit, prior written authorization from OASIS. *
6. User agrees to retain OASIS data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the research purposes described in User’s application. Upon completion of the research or upon request by OASIS, User will securely destroy or return all copies of the data. *
7. Acknowledgements and Citations: User will acknowledge the use of OASIS data and data derived from OASIS data when publicly presenting any results or algorithms that benefitted from their use. Papers, book chapters, books, posters, oral presentations, and all other printed and digital presentations of results derived from OASIS data should contain the following: *
