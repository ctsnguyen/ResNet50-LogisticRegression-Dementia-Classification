# Configurations
## What to do?
Set up the model here, we will define the blocks (like residuals, convolution input layer).

We can figure this out later

# Data
Also I think this is where we will see what we need to do with the data, for example like we define the augmentation, and how much we will adjust the batch size. 

Weights, etc
